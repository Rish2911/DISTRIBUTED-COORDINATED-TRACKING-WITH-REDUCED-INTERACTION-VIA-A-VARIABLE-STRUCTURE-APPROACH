# DISTRIBUTED-COORDINATED-TRACKING-WITH-REDUCED-INTERACTION-VIA-A-VARIABLE-STRUCTURE-APPROACH

The paper presented a situation of coordinated tracking with a leader and several followers.
The conditions of both first order kinematics and second order dynamics are considered
with varying as well as fixed velocity of the leader. The leader is defined as dynamic and
a neighbour of atleast one follower to prove the algorithms proposed in the paper. The
followers are allowed to have local interaction and partial measurement if they are neighbour
of each other which can be considered as a minimum distance between two followers. The
state of the leader is available to the followers who have the leader as their neighbour. In
first order kinematics they proposed algorithms considering cases of distributed consensus
tracking with both fixed and switching graph or network topologies and prove that the
tracking with fixed network topology can be achieved in finite time and for switching
network topology the tracking will be achieved but a fixed time cannot be defined for this
because of the switching pattern of the network topology. The proposal is then extended to
distributed swarm tracking with switching network topology but again with converging error
but no bound of time. In second order dynamics, they again start with a case of distributed
consensus tracking without any acceleration measurements with both switching and fixed
network and by proposing a control parameter, algorithm and proving the derivative of
the potential function to be negative definite they have proved that the algorithms at least
guarantee global exponential tracking. Also, a mechanism is introduced for keeping adaptive
connectivity maintenance by defining adjacency matrix according to three different scenarios
based on distance between followers. Then a case is considered where leaderâ€™s velocity is
taken constant in both distributed consensus tracking and distributed swarm tracking. Again
a mechanism is introduced using potential function derivative according to three different
situations to avoid collision as well as maintaining connectivity.
Most of the simulations of this publication have been reproduced by us.
